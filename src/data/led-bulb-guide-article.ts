      </div>

      <p>LEDs have changed this paradigm entirely. They are incredibly efficient at converting electricity into light. A 60-watt incandescent bulb produces approximately 800 lumens of light. An LED bulb, on the other hand, can produce the same 800 lumens while consuming only 8-12 watts of power. This dramatic difference highlights why lumens are the true measure of brightness for LED lighting.</p>

      <p>To effectively replace an old incandescent bulb, you need to match its lumen output, not its wattage. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>25W incandescent = 4W LED (250 lumens)</li>
        <li>40W incandescent = 6W LED (450 lumens)</li>
        <li>60W incandescent = 9W LED (800 lumens)</li>
        <li>100W incandescent = 14W LED (1600 lumens)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Color Temperature Explained: Setting the Mood with Light</h2>
      <p>Beyond brightness, the 'feel' of light is largely determined by its color temperature, measured in Kelvin (K). This metric describes the warmth or coolness of the light emitted by a bulb, influencing the ambiance and functionality of a space. Understanding color temperature is crucial for creating the desired atmosphere in different rooms of your home.</p>

      <h3>2700K-3000K: Warm White (Cozy, Relaxing)</h3>
